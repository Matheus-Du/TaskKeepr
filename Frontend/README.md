# Frontend Application

This is the frontend application of the TaskKeepr project. It is a React application that uses the [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) framework for styling.

## Getting Started

This app functions similar to any other React application. To get started, clone this repository and run `npm install` to install all dependencies. Then, run `npm start` to start the development server.

Keep in mind that this application requires the backend to be running in order to function properly. See the [backend README](../backend/README.md) for more information.

Deployment will also require setting up both the Cohere API and the CockroachDB database. Consult the relevant documentation for more information.
